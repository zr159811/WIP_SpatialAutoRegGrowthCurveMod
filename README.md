# WIP_SpatialAutoRegGrowthCurveMod


This is a work in progress on a current model I am developing, a spatial-autoregressive growth curve model. 

The general idea is that I want to model a spatial spillover process (e.g., covid-19 spread in geographic space), as a function
of a temporal growth trend. This is a novel model and is a first step in a series of models I am building to integrate
spatio-temporal effects for a variety of situations. 

The benefits of this model is the minimal asumptions we need to make about the temporal process. This is a trade off 
against, the implied stationarity assumption for the spatial autoregressive effects (Typically a plausible assumption for many effects).
